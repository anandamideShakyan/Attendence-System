# Attendence-System
I have built a website using react. It has two views Home(where we enter name and rollno of the students) and List(where we can see all the students who are present in the school and here we can checkout a students when he leaves the school). The total visited tab on the top right shows total no of students who came to the school. The current strength tab shows total student who checkedin but not checkedout ie they are currently inside the school premises. Checkin and Checkout times are calculated automatically. 

## Installation

npm i && npm start
